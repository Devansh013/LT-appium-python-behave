# Behave 

*Behave is a tool made to be used with Python testing frameworks, such as PyTest and Nose. It enables you to write tests in a natural language-like manner and execute them against your code.*

Learn the basics of [Appium testing on the LambdaTest platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/getting-started-with-appium-testing/).

## Behave With Appium

In this topic, you will learn how to configure and run your **Behave** automation testing scripts with **Appium** on **LambdaTest Real Device Cloud platform**.

## Objective

By the end of this topic, you will be able to:

1. Run a sample automation script of **Behave** for application testing with **Appium** on **LambdaTest**.
2. Learn more about Desired Capabilities for Appium testing.
3. Explore advanced features of LambdaTest.

## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing App automation testing with Appium, you would need to follow these steps:

- Install the latest stable Python build from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Make sure **pip** is installed in your system. You can install **pip** from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### Clone The Sample Project

**Step-1:** Clone the LambdaTestâ€™s :link: [LT-appium-python-behave](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python-behave) repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python-behave
cd LT-appium-python-behave
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/).

**Step-2:** Set LambdaTest `Username` and `Access Key` in environment variables.

**For Linux/macOS:**

  {`export LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}" \\
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}"
 
**For Windows:**

  {`set LT_USERNAME="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}" \
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}`}"
  
### Upload Your Application

**Step-3:** Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the LambdaTest servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

**Using App File:**

**For Linux/macOS:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" \\
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \\
--form 'name="Android_App"' \\
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"' 
`}

**For Windows:** 

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk""`}

**Using App URL:**

**Linux/macOS:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" \\
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \\
--form 'name="Android_App"' \\
--form 'url="https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk"'`}

**For Windows:**

{`curl -u "${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME()}:${ YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY()}" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -d "{\"url\":\"https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk\",\"name\":\"sample.apk\"}"`}

**Tip:**

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.

## Run Your First Test

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first Behave test on LambdaTest.

Test Scenario: Check out [Android.py](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python-behave/blob/master/steps/AndroidStepDef.py) file to view the sample test script for android and [iOS.py](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python-behave/blob/master/steps/IosStepDef.py) for iOS.

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

**Step-4:** You need to update your capabilities in `appConfig.py` files. In this sample project, we have provided the examples for running tests on both **Android** and **iOS** apps. We are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code for a single test are defined as:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios-config" label="iOS" default>

```python title="appConfig.py"
app_ios_desired_caps = {
    "deviceName":"iPhone 12",
    "platformName":"ios",
    "platformVersion":"14",
    "build":"Python Behave - iOS",
    "name":"Sample Test iOS",
    "isRealMobile":True,
    "network":True,
    "visual":True,
    "video":True,
    "app":"lt://" #Enter app_url here
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="android-config" label="Android" default>

```python title="appConfig.py"
app_android_desired_caps = {
    "deviceName":"Galaxy S20",
    "platformName":"Android",
    "platformVersion":"10",
    "build":"Python Behave - Android",
    "name":"Sample Test Android",
    "isRealMobile":True,
    "network":True,
    "visual":True,
    "video":True,
    "app":"lt://" #Enter app_url here
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

**Info Note:**

- You must add the generated **APP_URL** to the `"app"` capability in the config file.
- You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt :link: **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/beta/index.html)**. A more Detailed Capability Guide is available [here :page_facing_up:](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/) .

### Executing The Tests

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS" default>

**Step-5:** Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

```bash
behave --tags @iosApp
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="android" label="Android" default>

**Step-5:** Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

```bash
behave --tags @androidApp
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

**Info:** Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the :link: [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
